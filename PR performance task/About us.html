    <p id="parapgraphs">
        Techton was founded after seeing
        many developers stuck in finding any
        progress in learning something new,
        a term we call "Tutorial Hell".
        Because of these issue, all 10 of
        us developers gathered to form a group
        to help developers who are stuck in finding
        any progress in their learnings

        <p id="parapgraphs">
            We chose the name <b>TECHTON</b> because it  
            embodies the purpose of our project. The name is a blend of creativity, 
            collaboration, and purpose. The word <b>“TECH”</b> is recognized in shorthand for technology, 
            while <b>“TON”</b> was added because it gives a <b>"Ton"</b> of information, knowledge, and value. Together, 
            <b>"TECHTON"</b> represents a space where technology and alat of potential come together.
            The name doesn't have a historical backstory but was born from our brainstorming, 
            and random ideas in our brain.

        <h1 id="texts">Our Goal</h1>

        <p id="parapgraphs">
            our goal is to help developers to learn much faster
            and easier for them, and to inspire those to come in the future.
            <br>
            <br>
            But for now, our goal is to polish our website, and turn it
            into a way better website than what it looks like right now, because
            this website is lacking any color and personality, we are working on 
            the functions first!

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Here is a list of what we will be currently doing:</h1>
        <ul>
            
            <li>Polishing our website</li>
            <li>Finding a proper color palette and design</li>
            <li>Getting it out of Demo phase and to Alpha testing, and soon to its full release</li>
        </ul>
